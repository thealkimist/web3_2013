	<p class="jellod">My brief attempt to veer away from interaction as "technology" and deal with interaction with the good ol' gustatory sense. This approach led me down the road of actually thinking about the basic qualities of the sensation of taste how in a sense they "instruct" us. My resolution was actualized in taking jello and strip away its distinctiveness (making them all the same color) but making each flavor different. The test was to see how people interacted with eight different flavors of jello that no one could visually distinguish.<br><br>Materials: Gelatin, garlic, ginger, garlic, curry, onion, ginger, cocoa, cinnamon, sugar</p>
