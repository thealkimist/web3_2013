Web 3
=============================
### PSAM 5150 B

Course Description
-----------------------------
### Catalog Entry
Applications rarely are comprised of a tangled set of static files. They're dynamic. They update. They remember things. The course will introduce the concepts of a database and Web applications as a set of design problems. The class will investigate server-side applications, third-party data sources and APIs and how applications can become dynamic and highly functional. To approach the design and construction of applications that derive from datasources and databases, this course builds upon an essential knowledge of Web Standards, user interface design, and usability to support the creation of functional and responsive projects for the Web across multiple devices and platforms. Students will incorporate interaction design, visual design, user experience and code to rapidly sculpt data into content. By the end of the course, students should be able to design, build and deploy data-driven Web applications. The course employs a pedagogy suitable for designers, artists and technologists who seek an empowerment achieved by being able to build data-driven applications.

### Expanded Description
Twenty years ago the web was a very different space.It was there for a single purpose: To help researchers collaborate together. Today it's about so much more: remembering, retrieving, sharing, playing, discovering, connecting, shopping, socializing, displaying, engaging, deciding, acting. 

Bootcamp, Web 1 and Web 2 have shown you the principle building blocks of the web. In Web 3 we'll expand on those in as many ways as we can. Our time together will focus on demystifying all that goes into the creation of a web site, from server to content management systems. At the same time we'll aim to refine techniques, tools and processes.

More importantly to me, we'll balance the refining of craftsmanship with discussions about the pervasiveness of the web in our society and our lives and how we as makers can inform that.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------------------
Students who take this class will:

- better comprehend how all pieces of the web come together and work, from server to database to front-end.
- acquire a basic familiarity with web IT, enough to be able to host and run their own systems cheaply.
- get introduced to server side programming (PHP and NodeJS), including an introduction to industry standard Content Management Systems.
- further practice front-end design, including responsive design and strategies for pre-processing and optimizing load times.

Grading
-----------------------------
### Expectations
- Students will extensively leverage all forms of communication outlined here along with the MFADT network for assistance. Campfire, Office Hours, D12 are all available to you as resources.
- **Emailing me in a panic hours before an assignment is due is unacceptable**. 
- Adapting assignments to thesis or other coursework is welcome and encouraged.
- You will maintain a positive, constructive attitude.
- Take care of one another.

### Homework
Homework submission will be done via **GitHub**.

- Students will create a **separate** repository for their assignments.
- Students will complete assignments in that repository week by week.
- Assignments will be checked during office hours the subsequent Saturday.

Each assignment will be worth 100 points.

#### Is the assignment complete? (40 points)
- Does the code work?
- Is the code clean?
- Is it functional? 
- Does it complete the requirements outlined in the assignment?


#### Is effort put into the completion of the assignment? (40 points)
Like any practice you're first adopting, you will struggle with code. If you are new to programming I expect you will struggle with the criteria above.

I will be looking for progress in the form of **commit history**. I want to see that you are pushing up iterations of your work.

If you are completing the assignments easily I'll be looking for you to find ways to **push yourself** through experimentation and iteration.


#### Are you completing the assignment in a timely fashion? (20 points)
Assignments due dates will be clearly outlined. If your commit history bears evident that you did not start working in earnest until the day before the assignment was due, you will lose these 15 points.


#### Notes
- Weeks with no homework assigned will be weighted appropriately.
- Midterm and Final will be worth 500 points each.

-----------------------------

### Overall Grading

Each week will be worth **200 points**, including the aforementioned homework. The remaining points are as follows:

#### Are you showing up to class on time? (50 points)
If you are later than 15 minutes to class you will be marked as late and docked these points.

In addition if you are late 3 times you fail the class.

#### Are you participating in the class? (50 points)
These are the points most easily lost year after year. It confounds me.

I understand there are different personality types - some of you are shy or less open to contribute to class discussions as often as others. However, to make this as clear as possible:

#### I can see what you are doing. I am looking at you while we are in class together.

If it is clear you are texting, IMing, giggling at Reddit or whatever during class points will be deducted.

Grading Standards
-----------------------------
**F.** Failing grades are given for required work that is not submitted,
for incomplete final projects or for examinations that are not taken
(without prior notification and approval). Fs are given to students who
show no comprehension whatsoever of the topics discussed in class and no
forthcomingness to attempt to comprehend. Make-up work or completion of
missed examinations may be permitted only with the approval of the
instructor and the program director.

**D.** D grades are given for required work that is consistently received
late or incomplete and a lack of comprehension of the topics discussed
in class. D students turn assignments in late and typically do not
function correctly or required heavy assistance from their peers to
function at all. This is visibly demonstrated by comparing one students’
assignment to the next.

**C/C+.** Average grades will be given to students who fail to
collaborate in the point system described above. This may include
showing up late for class or expressing visible disdain for the
assignments, including failing to help struggling peers or request help
if they are struggling themselves. C+ students will often be quiet
during lecture time rather than articulating confusion or challenging
the topic at hand.

**B/B+.** Does everything a C/C+ assignment would do with a more
enthusiastic approach to the overall class. A B+ student will complete
the assignments on time and enthusiastically discuss the topics during
class time.

**A.** An A student does exceptional work. They may not be the best
programmer, but they demonstrate comprehension by submitting multiple
iterations of their progression through problems with each assignment. A
students contribute to the larger class by helping struggling students
out in and outside of class time. A students are active in course
discussions and even in shaping what they want to take out of the class
time.

**I.** A grade of I (Incomplete), signifying a temporary deferment of a
regular grade, may be assigned when coursework has been delayed at the
end of the semester for unavoidable and legitimate reasons. Incomplete
grades are given only with the written approval of the instructor and
the program director. The Request for an Incomplete Grade form must be
filled out by the student and instructor prior to the end of the
semester.

For undergraduate students, if a grade of incomplete is approved,
outstanding work must be submitted by the seventh week of the following
Fall semester (for Spring and Summer courses) or by the seventh week of
the following Spring semester (for Fall courses). Otherwise, a grade of
I will automatically convert to a permanent unofficial withdrawal (WF)
after a period of four weeks. For graduate students, the maximum
deadline for completion of an incomplete is one year though a shorter
period may be imposed at the discretion of the instructor.

Divisional, Program and Class Policies
-----------------------------
###Responsibility

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.
Late papers, failure to complete the readings assigned for class
discussion, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and
presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.

###Participation

Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping
up with reading, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active
participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.

###Attendance

Faculty members may fail any student who is absent for a significant
portion of class time. A significant portion of class time is defined as
three absences for classes that meet once per week and four absences for
classes that meet two or more times per week. During intensive summer
sessions a significant portion of class time is defined as two absences.
Lateness or early departure from class may also translate into one full
absence.

###Blackboard

We will not be using Blackboard during class.

###Delays

In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class. If I have not
arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum
of thirty minutes for my arrival. In the event that I will miss class
entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your
assignment for the next class meeting.

###Academic Integrity

This is the university’s Statement on Academic Integrity: “Plagiarism
and cheating of any kind in the course of academic work will not be
tolerated. Academic honesty includes accurate use of quotations, as well
as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of
paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or
any aspect of the work of others (including that of instructors and
other students). These standards of academic honesty and citation of
sources apply to all forms of academic work (examinations, essays,
theses, computer work, art and design work, oral presentations, and
other projects).”

It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to
their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their
own work from that of others. Compromising your academic integrity may
lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more
of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course,
academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the
university, or dismissal from the university.

Every student at Parsons signs an Academic Integrity Statement as a part
of the registration process. Thus, you are held responsible for being
familiar with, understanding, adhering to and upholding the spirit and
standards of academic integrity as set forth by the Parsons Student
Handbook.

###Guidelines for Written Assignments

Plagiarism is the use of another person's words or ideas in any academic
work using books, journals, internet postings, or other student papers
without proper acknowledgment. For further information on proper
acknowledgment and plagiarism, including expectations for paraphrasing
source material and proper forms of citation in research and writing,
students should consult the Chicago Manual of Style (cf. Turabian, 6th
edition). The University Writing Center also provides useful on-line
resources to help students understand and avoid plagiarism. See
[http://www.newschool.edu/admin/writingcenter/](http://www.newschool.edu/admin/writingcenter/).

Students must receive prior permission from instructors to submit the
same or substantially overlapping material for two different
assignments. Submission of the same work for two assignments without the
prior permission of instructors is plagiarism.

###Guidelines for Studio Assignments

Work from other visual sources may be imitated or incorporated into
studio work if the fact of imitation or incorporation and the identity
of the original source are properly acknowledged. There must be no
intent to deceive; the work must make clear that it emulates or comments
on the source as a source. Referencing a style or concept in otherwise
original work does not constitute plagiarism. The originality of studio
work that presents itself as “in the manner of” or as playing with
“variations on” a particular source should be evaluated by the
individual faculty member in the context of a critique.

Incorporating ready-made materials into studio work as in a collage,
synthesized photograph or paste-up is not plagiarism in the educational
context. In the commercial world, however, such appropriation is
prohibited by copyright laws and may result in legal consequences.

###Student Disability Services

In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for
students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs
academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All
conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any
accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the office of
Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if
appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to
you to bring to me. At that point I will review the letter with you and
discuss these accommodations in relation to this course. Mr. Luchs’
office is located in 79 Fifth Avenue, 5th floor. His direct line is
(212) 229-5626 x3135. You may also access more information through the
University’s web site at [http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/](http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/).
